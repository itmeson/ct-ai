=====
Day 1
=====

 1. We're going to spend the first part of today walking through the tic-tac-toe program as it stand right now, aiming to understand how it works and how the pieces of it work together.  
     
 2. Our programming goal for today is to write the function is_win(), whose job is to check the current state of the board and report back whether or not anyone has yet won.

=====
Day 2
=====

 1. Video on an `optimistic vision of the future of AI <https://www.ted.com/talks/maurice_conti_the_incredible_inventions_of_intuitive_ai#t-911753>`_
 
 2. What does this `program do <random-string.html>`_?
 
 3. Submit `mid-trimester reflection survey <https://goo.gl/forms/AAf4PU9RvOAcBKZE2>`_

 4. If time, continue work on the is_win() function in the tic-tac-toe engine, and play some games to test it.
