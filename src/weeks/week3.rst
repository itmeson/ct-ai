Day 1
=====

 1. Challenge 1: write code that can produce a row of squares, alternating between filled-in and not-filled-in
 2. Challenge 2: write a function that allows you to produce a square whenever you want it, without typing in multiple lines
 3.  We watched a video about 6 different study strategies that are more effective than cramming.  In the discussion below, leave a comment discussing one of the techniques and how you might be able to incorporate it into your study process.  Since this class is in part about teaching machines to learn, I think it makes sense to put some thought into how humans learn too
