Day 1
=====

 1. We discussed the concepts of false negatives and false positives in the context of an email spam filter, whose job is to reliably classify all incoming mail so that you don't see any spam messages and you don't miss any important messages.  There is an inherent trade-off between decreasing the false negative rate (the percentage of spam emails that end up in your inbox) and decreasing the false positive rate (the percentage of good emails that end up in the trash), and this tradeoff is present in every classification problem.

Day 2
=====

 1. On a whiteboard work out what false negative, false positive, true negative and true positive mean in the context of a recommender system like on Netflix, Amazon, or a music streaming service.

 2. Read the `blog post about the creation of the OpenAI foundation <https://blog.openai.com/introducing-openai/>`_ and comment below about your impressions of it.  Look around at more of their web site to see some of the projects they work on.

 3. Work on one of the following:

    a. Completing your program that can play a game of tic-tac-toe without stalling
    b. If your program works, connect it into the learning program that I provided and play your program against the learning bot.
    c. Come up with an experiment to try on the learning system and run it.  (Like, "suppose I train against a random bot for 200,000 games, then train against another learner for 200,000 games, then test it by playing it myself....". 
    d. Go back to the earlier python programs we wrote drawing pictures using loops and functions, and create something spectacular

 4. Please talk to Mark about what you are working on.
