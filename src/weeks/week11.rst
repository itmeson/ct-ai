Day 1
=====

We're going to watch a talk about the possibility of losing control of artificial general intelligence -- an AI system that is flexible enough to do most of the intellectual tasks that humans can do, but can do them much faster than humans.  The possibility of developing such an AI has huge implications for the future and I think it is important to think about those implications whether or not you think this will actually happen and whether or not you think those implications are negative or positive.  The speaker in this video is worried about the future, but I'm not showing it to freak us out, but to open up a conversation about these implications.  When you write a response to the video in the comments, I want you to consider:

 1. What are the claims made about AI and likely future results of it?
 2. What questions do you have about the claims made in the talk?
 3. What do you think should be done about it, and why?
 4. If artificial general intelligence was a likely possibility in the next few years, what minimum set of values would you want it to have, so as to best protect human interests?
