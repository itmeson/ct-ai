=====
Day 1
=====

 1. We looked at an example of machine learning at work as two programs learned to play tic-tac-toe against each other.  An interesting result was that even after 100,000 games, the bot was not perfect -- it missed obvious block and win opportunities, though it did manage to force ties *most* of the time.


=====
Day 2
=====

1. We watched some videos explaining some examples of algorithmic bias and discussed their importance and how they relate to the training of a tic-tac-toe player.

2. News report about the racist twitter bot:
