I've listed here a few topics of discussion that we may address in the coming weeks, I'd like you to use the Comment feature below to add a few potential topics of your own, based on your notes from watching the documentary AlphaGo.  Then I'd like you to come back to vote on topics you find particularly interesting or important.


 * What does intelligence mean?
 * How closely must a thing resemble a human in order to be considered intelligent?
 * Is it possible for machines to become more intelligent than people?
 * What is impressive about a computer playing Go better than any human? What is *not* impressive about it?
